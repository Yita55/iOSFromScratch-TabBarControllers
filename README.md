### Envato Tuts+ Tutorial: iOS From Scratch With Swift: Exploring Tab Bar Controller

#### Instructor: Bart Jacobs

In the previous tutorial, we discussed how a navigation controller enables the user to navigate hierarchical content or complex data by managing a stack of view controllers. Tab bar controllers also manage an array of view controllers. The difference is that the view controllers of a tab bar controller don't necessarily have a relation to one another. In this tutorial, we will explore tab bar controllers in more detail by creating a tabbed application from scratch.
